    <h2>White Rice recipe</h2>
    <p>In this recipe we will make white asian rice. It takes about 30/45 minutes.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>250g rice</li>
        <li>a pot with a lid</li>
        <li>strainer</li>
        <li>obviously a cooking plate</li>
        <li>water</li>
        <li>optional> a bit of salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the dry rice into the strainer. You can stir it a bit, to get rid of small particles in it, which will fall through the strainer. Rinse it with water 5-8 times</li>
        <li>Put the rice into the pot, fill it up with water, and stir it intensely for half a minute. If the water gets cloudy, change the water.
            If it gets cloudy very quick, repeat step 1 first. We want the water to stay clear when stirring the rice. That's how we know it is cleaned enough.</li>
        <li>when you're finished cleaning the rice, fill the rice into the pot with water. The waterline should only be 4 or 5 millimeters above the top of the rice.</li>
        <li>cook the rice on high for about 10min, then cook it further on half power until all water is evaporated. Watch out that the rice doesnt burn at the bottom, stirring at the end helps.
            Some will stick to the bottom though, that is normal. </li>
        <li>Now, put the rice into the strainer. You can taste a few rice corns for it's consistency, it should still be a bit too hard, but edible.</li>
        <li>Now, fill the pot to 1/3 or less with water. Put it back on the stove, the strainer with the rice onto the pot. 
            You can put the lid on, but dont close it fully, leave some space for the steam to evaporate. We dont want the water boiling to the top and wetting the rice, we only want steam to reach the rice.</li>
        <li>Let it steam for a while. Usually 15 min is good. Try a bit of rice, if it tastes good, you can start serving. 
            You can keep the rest of the rice on the stove on low power, that way, you can serve plate after plate of nice, fresh, warm and sticky asian rice.</li>
        <li>Enjoy! Or dont. Your choice.</li>
    </ol>
